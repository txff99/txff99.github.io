            It's been a while since I arrived. Too many things happened and was too bust to document anything here. 
            The moment I arrived here, I traveled with my parents in San Diego. We visited Misson Bay, La Jolla beach & Cove. And with the help of my parents, 
            I was able to buy many cooking stuff in my dorm. 
            After that I went to travel with my friends from middle school. We watched the MCS air show, walked in the mountain of Yosemite for hours.
            And also visited a golden farmland when we passed Fresno. 
            Though exciting it seems, I never felt truly happy and released after I arrived here. I never actually built any relationship in this campus 
            and all the time I was so alone. I thought talking to other people would help but it didn't. I felt lost because I have to live as a independent individual.
            When I was traveling with my friend JIN, he already lives a happy life with his girlfriend. Somehow I feel like the days we are children are gone. 
            Everyone eventually grows up and live ones own life.
            With no one to rely on, no one to contact. Everyone around is nobody but just a passer-by. I guess that's what a real adult life means,
             and I have to face it from now on. I feel like there's nothing in my life really matters now.
