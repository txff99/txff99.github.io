            Anyway, I've survived for the last few months, and suddenly I'm here. The Spring quarter.
            There's too much to say in the last few months. Huge huge amount of workload, stupid linear algebra course, 
            did a few Online Assessments for some job positions, did some leetcode but didn't get any OA since January.
            Generally speaking, it's all bad things. The only good thing happening is that I took a course CSE120, which is 
            about the operating system. It's really useful in terms of my following study in computer science. And most importantly
            it developed my interest in computer sciense. It gives me a chance to explore the fascinating concepts about computer system.
            The most interesting part is that I feel creative when I find the solution to a problem in my own way.

            I think the most vital thing leads to my unhappiness is that I didn't find an internship. I received a few OAs in January, 
            but I never received one since then. Probably the market has already closed. But I have to keep on trying until May. 
            If I still didn't find a job by then, I might find a RA during summer.

            This quarter I succeeded in enrolling in a course about network and another about parallel computing. They are both interesting and useful course,
            so I had luck. Actually, that's because a lot people choose to learn maching learning. So there are more the positions.
            However, I feel like the workload could probably be even heavier than last quarter. I have to use every minute! Any way, hope I can succeed in this quarter 
            and had some luck on finding the internship.
