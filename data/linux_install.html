            I changed my laptop OS today. It's painful.
            I was always thinking about changing my laptop OS before heading to the US, because the original windows 11 was nearly broken. 
            So I planned to install the ubuntu 22, as it's helpful for software development in the future.<br>
        </p>
        <!-- <h4>
            Here are some of the problems I met.
        </h4> -->
        <p>
            I used the rufus to burn the software in my usb. At first, the installation failed. It demonstrates an "i/o" error, 
            a failure during copying files. It suggests that something is wrong with CD/DVD or hard disk. 
            So I was thinking it might be a hardware failure, I should change my usb or the hard disk. 
            But it would require a huge effort. So I decided to try using different setting of the rufus first and install it again. 
            After several attempts, surprisingly, the installation succeeded. <br>
            It turned out that one of the setting should be GPT instead of MSR (could be this name or something else, don't remember). 
            Suppose I didn't try to reinstall it, but listen to that advice and changed the hardware, it could cost much more time and effort.<br>

            But who knows what will happen, last time I installed ubuntu. I didn't succeed until I changed the ssd in that computer. 
            Everything about computer is just so complicated and painful. There are always problems emerging and you have to make countless attempts 
            searching & finding a solution. <u><b>Basically, most of the computer engineering is time spent on dealing with problems. </b> </u>
            Even so, millons of people are still trying to enter this field. (Just like me.)
            I guess it just seems so cool to manipulate a computer and do the coding stuff.
