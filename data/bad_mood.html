            I should have enrolled in courses earlier. At least I should submit the easy request for cse100r. 
            The first week is like shit to me. As all these courses I want to enroll are either in waitlist or easy request.
            Last day I just got my first easy request of CSE100 approved, I found out I'm waitlisted on the 15th position. The due date of enrollment is about 10/12. 
            I think there's hardly any chance for me to enroll in that course. On the other hand, the course has a equivalent remote version called "CSE100R" 
            but I didn't request for it. Today I went to the CSE department, they told me I have to wait until the end of second week to get that request approved, 
            which is the date of enrollment ends. I will probably fail to enroll in that course.<br>
            So why is this course so important? The course is named advanced data stucture, which is the beginning course of anyone who starts to learn computer science.
            Why choosing to learn computer science? Am I not in the ECE department? My final goal of completing the study here is to become a capable engineer of robotics, 
            mostly on software development. Unlike hardware design, software design is more free and flexible. It also has more access to the algorithm, 
            wields the knowledge of both engineering and science. I think it is my ideal job. But the ECE courses can never provide the basic ability of software development.
            That's why cs courses are so important. <br>
            Currently I'm not enrolled in any courses that will lead me on the path of software development. I really hope I can. Because it's not only about the cse course but 
            it also means that I can avoid some ECE math courses which are not helpful to my goal. I mean, math is cool, but currently I need more technical skills.<br>
            I'm really having a hard time these days. Even some small things would make me happy for a while, like my waitlist moves 1 position forward..... Just hope things get better.
