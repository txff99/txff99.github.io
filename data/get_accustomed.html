            Man I want to get a surfboard. It's been 3 weeks since I arrived. I never feel my life so enriched with business before. 
            This week acts as the official start of my journey. I literally spent the whole week doing homework. Sadly I didn't enroll in the course cse100.
            But now I feel like I don't need to. Since I already know a lot about data structure. Also after this semester, I get a thorough understanding of how Easy 
            request system works. I don't think they would really stop you from enrolling in the course as long as you submit it early and there are still positions left.
            Surprisingly, I did enroll in the course cse276, which is introduction to robotics. The workload of this course is huuuuge. 
            I basically spent the whole week messing around with the robot. But I feel that I really like this course, because I can actually get my hand on a robot 
            when I said my major is robotics. I also found an amazing teammate, jiahao li. He is a second year cs major student. He is a person with great capability.
            I think I can learn a lot from him. <br>
            For the career part, occasionally, I would submit a few resume on handshake or linkedin. With rejection and no message for sure. But always better than doing nothing.<br>
            For entertainment, I got enrolled in the surfing lesson. It's something that finally delights me in the depression, the feeling of surfing. 
            I also met a few classmates who are also fond of surfing. interacting with them are really fun.
            I hope I can get my surfboard as soon as possible.
