            This is the place where I document some of my thoughts and experience.<br>
            Basically it's a diary consisted of nonsense. 
            But I think it can help me improve my bad language arrangement and remind me of something interesting.<br>
            So here I am, today is 2023/8/15, the end of this summer vacation. I'm going to San Diego in the mid of Sep.
            I'm using this last period of time to learn and prepare for my study at ucsd.
            Here are some of the things I'm trying to do from a couple weeks till now.
            <h2>
                TODO:
            </h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Learning Statistics: Reading the book given by Xiaolong. Progress:Chapter Two</li>
                <li>Learning C/C++: trying to align with Embedded System learning. build some useful
                    programs involving web programming, multitasks, qt, sdl2, opencv.
                </li>
                <li>Learning embedded systems: bought a stm32f401re nucleo. beginner's level.</li>
                <li>Full stack program: still thinking about whether to do it or not. Don't want to learn java.</li>
            </ul>

            btw, I was struggling to equip skyrim mods for a few days. Now it's bascially complete, 
            and I'm able to play it for a little while I still have time to play.)
